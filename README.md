This is a simple wordle script I created for fun.

```
npm i
```
```
node index
```


1. Start with your first guess on Wordle.
2. Enter first guess in terminal with its results
   - r = **Letter is in the word and correct spot**
   - y or b = **Letter is in the word but wrong spot**
   - g  = **letter is not in the word in any spot**
   
3. Program will display possible answers
4. Enter another word on Wordle. (Enter word from the program's list)
5. Repeat 2-4 until you win!
